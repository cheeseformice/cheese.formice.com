        These essentially enable us (or our third party partners, as detailed below) to store
        information on your browser or device to enable us or them to identify you and monitor
        certain activities, for the purposes set out in this policy.<br />

        They may:
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            expire at the end of your browser session (allowing us to link your activities during
            that session – these are often called “session cookies”);
          </li>
          <li>
            be stored on your browser/device in between sessions, enabling us to remember your
            preferences and actions for future visits. They need to be manually deleted or will
            expire after the particular period set by that cookie – these are often referred to as
            “persistent cookies”;
          </li>
          <li>be set by CFM, which are often referred to as “first-party cookies”; or</li>
          <li>be set by third parties – often referred to as “third party cookies”.</li>
        </ol>

        <b
          >Importantly, we will not use any cookies/tracking technologies (or permit any third
          parties to place these on our website) which are not strictly necessary for the operation
          of the website, without first getting your consent.</b

        You can always change your mind about all types of cookies/tracking technologies (see “How

        Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers
        of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies/similar
